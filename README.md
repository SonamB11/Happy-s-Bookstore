# Happy's Bookstore
Implement a bookstoreâ€™s inventory management system using the OOP model.
## Working
The bookstore needs to keep an inventory of the books or magazine it has,how many copies it
has, the price of each book, cost of each book to the store, etc. Whenever books are sold by the
store, or new stock is added to the store, the inventory needs to be updated.
